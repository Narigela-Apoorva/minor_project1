            <h2>TAJ MAHAL</h2>
            <p align="center">The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.</p>
           
           <p align="center"><b>Interesting fact:</b>A shopping complex and hotel inspired by the Taj Mahal is being constructed in Dubai and is estimated to be four times larger in size.</p>

            <p align="center">To get a sense of the rich history of the Mughal era, visit the walled palatial Agra Fort, one of the famous historical places in India that is built entirely of red sandstone. Built in 1565 by Akbar, this historical tourist place in India has two ornately designed gates: the Amar Singh Gate and the Delhi Gate. You can only enter through the Amar Singh Gate to uncover an ancient city filled with gateways, courts, passages, palaces and mosques. It is one of the most beautiful places to visit in Agra.
            </p>

            <h2>HAWA MAHAL</h2>
            <p align="center">The ‘Palace of Winds’ or Hawa Mahal gets its name due to the fact that it looks like a honeycomb of a beehive with its 953 intricate windows. It is also shaped like a crown as the ruler who built it, Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, was a major devotee of Lord Krishna. One of the popular tourist places in Jaipur, this palace is known as the tallest building in the world that doesn’t have any foundation. The palace is curved but still stands firm due to its pyramidal shape.
            </p>
           
           <p align="center"><b>Interesting fact:</b>It was believed that this building was created so that the royal ladies could look outside as they were constantly under ‘purdah’</p>

            <p align="center">This 42-meter monument is often compared with Arch de Triomphe in Paris and Arch of Constantine in Rome. Located on the Rajpath, it was designed by Edwin Lutyens. Dedicated to the 82,000 soldiers of both Indian and British descent who fought in World War One and 13,300 soldiers who were martyred in the 3rd Anglo-Afghan War, it was built in 1931. Every year, the Republic Day Parade is held here. It is a famous destination among both locals and tourists.

            <p align="center">Khajuraho has always been thought of as the place that exemplifies sensuality and eroticism at its best. However this is a misrepresentation as only about 10 percent of the sculptures are sensual and the rest are common depictions. Countless sculptures depicting love, eternal grace, beauty, delicacy and the creative arts can be seen in one of the most historical places in India. A perfect amalgamation of Hinduism and Jainism, Khajuraho temples have carvings of cult icons, demi gods and Apsaras.
            </p>
           
           <p align="center"><b>Interesting fact:</b>The city got its name as it was adorned with date palms and “Khajura’ means date palms in Hindi. It was also often called Khajjurpura in ancient times.</p>
